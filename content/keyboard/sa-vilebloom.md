## Keycaps: SA Vilebloom

Got my first set of SA keycaps. I was expecting that I might hate the tall sculpted caps given my propensity for DSA, but frankly I find I enjoy them equally as much. I also thought I'd want to use the think, heavy, plastic caps on heavier switches, maybe my Box Royals, but I'm currently enjoying the caps on my 62g Zilents.

I have had one problem with the keyset though. During my first day of use I found that the space bar would slip continuously off of it's stabilizers. After a little bout of frustration I came up with a simple solution; I applied a little bit of cotton wool to the top of the stabilizers that filled the gaps and gripped the space bar firmly.
