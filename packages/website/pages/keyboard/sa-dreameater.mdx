# Keycaps: SA DreamEater

![](flickr://51115115292 "The Final Result.")

My second, ultra-expensive set of SA keycaps. The same excellent finish and feel as my [other set](/keyboard/sa-vilebloom), and I even had the same problem with getting the spacebar to stay on the stabs, which I resolved in the same way.
