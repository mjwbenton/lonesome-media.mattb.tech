# UT47.2

![](flickr://50682227532)

I got in on this board after really struggling to adapt to ortholinear with my [Niu Mini](/keyboard/niu-mini). I was still interested in the 40% size, and felt that I could adapt to using layers, but the lack of stagger was a challenge for me. This board is proving that theory correct, and its a long way towards getting daily use by me.

Continuing on from the Niu Mini, I've again tried to create a layout that's easy for me coming from my 60% boards, so that I can reuse as much muscle memory as possible.
