## Lockdown 2020

With little else to keep us sane, 2020 became the year of walking every nook and cranny of the area around my flat in Clifton. Part way through, I bought a dream camera of mine, the Leica Monochrom (M9M, CCD sensor). What follows is lots of black and white pictures of my local area, mostly taken on the M9M, with a few M10 photos from before I got the M9M.
