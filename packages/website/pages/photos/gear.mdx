# Gear

This post is to catalog the history of gear that I have owned. I initially became enthused with photography when I was mildly jealous of a digtal Canon compact camera that my sister had bought. It took AA batteries and drained them in a matter of minutes. My own first camera was a <Camera name="Fuji FinePix F30" />. My first "serious" camera, which at the time I would have thought of as completely synonymous with being a DSLR, was a <Camera name="Pentax K-m" />. Wanting cheaper lenses led me to older manual focus Pentax K mount lenses, and those in turn led me to the <Camera name="Pentax MX" /> 35mm film SLR. Everything else just follows from there.

### My First Camera

My first camera was a <Camera name="Fuji FinePix F30" />.

I'd done lots of online research reading reviews. I think I learned a lot of the basics of photography before I'd picked up the camera just be reading about it. ISO/Aperture/Shutter speed etc.

Looking back at it, it took nice pictures for what it was. Technology has come a long way though - these are clearly worse in many ways than an phone from 10 years later.

### The Pentax Era

I wanted to get a "proper camera". At the time this meant a DSLR. I was already into the idea of small though, something that would stick with me, bar a few mistakes here and there. The <Camera name="Pentax K-m" /> was one of the smallest DSLRs available at the time, and I remember being really bought into the idea of the in-body image stablization.

I had a couple of not-great kit lenses that came as part of the set.

I gained some understanding somewhere along the line that prime lenses would be sharper than zoom lenses. I'm not sure about today, but at the time, this was as true as anything. I didn't have much money to spend, but there were tons of quick prime lenses for Pentax K mount on eBay for < £30. I bought a <Lens name="smc Pentax-M 50mm f1.7" /> for somewhere around that figure, and I took 95%+ of my photos from then on using that lens. It didn't have auto-focus, which didn't bother me one bit (dispite me missing focus quite a lot given the limited help I got from the K-m body), and with the crop factor, it was the equivilant of a slightly awkward 75mm. But the pictures were sharper, and taking pictures was infinitely more fun.

I bought some other lenses. They got used, but not exactly a lot in comparison to the nifty-fifty.

Just before the end of the year, I bought a film SLR for K mount, the <Camera name="Pentax MX" />. This is the camera that took my interest in photography another level. Playing around with film in 2009 had become a pretty niche interest. I shot my first roll of film visiting a friend studying a year abroad in Gratz alongside another friend.

### Pentax Continued

After hearing about my ventures into film, my Uncle passed his old film SLR onto me, which just so happened to be another Pentax, a <Camera name="Pentax K1000" /> with a <Lens name="smc Pentax-M 50mm f2" />. I barely touched the lens given I had the f1.7 version, and I'm pretty sure I ended up giving it to my sister at some point.

[Photos tagged with <Camera name="Pentax K1000" />](/photos/tag?tag=Pentax%20K1000)

I didn't stop at 2 film SLRs. I added a <Camera name="Pentax ME Super" /> to the collection as it had aperture priority, which appealed to me over the fully manual process of shooting with the MX or K1000.

It's interesting how my interest in automation has changed over time. I feel quite firmly now that I want control over all of the things that are going to make the photo look like I want it to, and as little of anything else as possible. That means to me that aperture priority, with an exposure compensation dial trumps fully manual, as the vast majority time the shutter speed isn't really an important part of the end image as long as its exposed correctly.

I added a couple more lenses as well. First ultra-wide <Lens name="Cosina 20mm f3.8 MC" /> />, which I appear to have barely touched, and by most accounts is not a great lens. Second, and more interestingly, the <Lens name="smc Pentax-M 40mm f2.8" /> which is a tiny pancake lens.

### Canon Digital

While I continued on the Pentax front for film cameras, I'd fallen out with the <Camera name="Pentax K-m" />. In many respects it just wasn't very good, and I didn't have the right lenses given the crop factor! I remember bidding on this big batch load of Canon lenses alongside a <Camera name="Canon 40D" /> on ebay in the middle of a Computer Science lab at University. My student maintainace loan had come through, and I blew a huge chunk of it on this knowing I could sell most of the lenses and make a profit even when keeping the 40D.

According to the EXIF data on the photos, I'd bought the camera off a guy called "Robert Olejnik" — apparently I never did a factory reset.

I sold all the lenses that came with the body with the exception of a <Lens name="Canon EF 50mm f1.8 II" />. Shortly afterwards I added a <Lens name="Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC HSM" />. I have really fond memories of the Sigma; 30mm is finally a sensible normal focal length on a body with a crop factor.
