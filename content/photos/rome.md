## Roman Streets

Street photography from a bunch of touristy locations in Rome where all these photos were taken on a weekend in January 2011.

Square format pictures were taken with a _Yashica Mat 124_ and _Neopan 100 Acros_ film, whilst 35mm pictures were taken with a _Pentax_ SLR a _Pentax-M 50/1.7_ lens, and a variety of faster speed, grainier, black and white films.
