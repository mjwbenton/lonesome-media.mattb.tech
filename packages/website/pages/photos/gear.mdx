## Gear

This post is to catalog the history of gear that I have owned. I initially became enthused with photography when I was mildly jealous of a digtal Canon compact camera that my sister had bought. It took AA batteries and drained them in a matter of minutes. My own first camera was a Fuji FinePix F30. My first "serious" camera, which at the time I would have thought of as completely synonymous with being a DSLR, was a Pentax K-m. Wanting cheaper lenses led me to older manual focus Pentax K mount lenses, and those in turn led me to the Pentax MX 35mm film SLR. Everything else just follows from there.
